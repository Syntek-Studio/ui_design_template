## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario 1: Installation Guide

- **When** they read docs/SETUP/INSTALLATION.md
- **Then** instructions cover npm/yarn installation
- **And** peer dependencies are clearly listed
- **And** configuration requirements are documented
- **And** troubleshooting section covers common issues

### Scenario 2: Template Initialisation Guide

- **And** CLI commands are shown with expected output
- **And** common mistakes are called out
- **And** post-init verification steps are included

### Scenario 3: Configuration Reference

## Tasks

- [ ] Create docs/SETUP/ directory

## Notes

Setup documentation is often the first thing users read. It should be clear, complete, and prevent common mistakes. Including visual aids (screenshots, GIFs) can greatly improve clarity.
