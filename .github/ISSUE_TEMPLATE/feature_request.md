## Problem Statement

<!--
Describe the problem this feature would solve.
Who encounters this problem? When do they encounter it?

Example:
"I'm always frustrated when I need to show contextual help but don't want to
use a bulky modal. Many interfaces need a small, non-intrusive way to display
additional information on hover or focus."
-->

## Proposed Solution

<!--
Describe the feature you'd like to see.
Include API/interface design if possible.

Example:
```typescript
import { Tooltip } from '@syntek-studio/ui';

<Tooltip content="Help text">
  <Button>Hover me</Button>
</Tooltip>
```
-->

## Alternatives Considered

<!--
List other approaches you've considered.
Why is your proposed solution better?

Example:
- Using a simple title attribute (limited styling, poor accessibility)
- Using a modal dialog (too intrusive for help text)
- Using an info icon with popover (good, but requires more click interactions)
-->

## Use Case

<!--
Explain real-world scenarios where this feature would be useful.
Be specific about who would use it and why.

Example:
"E-commerce teams need Tooltips for product descriptions on hover.
Form builders need them for inline help text next to inputs.
Admin dashboards need them for metric explanations."
-->

## Platforms

<!--
Which platforms should this feature support?
- Web (React)
- Mobile (React Native)
- Both (with platform-specific considerations)
-->

## Accessibility Considerations

<!--
How should this feature handle keyboard navigation and screen readers?
Are there ARIA attributes needed?

Example:
- Tooltip should appear on focus and hover
- Keyboard users can Tab to the element
- Screen reader announces the tooltip content via aria-describedby
- Close on Escape key for keyboard users
-->
