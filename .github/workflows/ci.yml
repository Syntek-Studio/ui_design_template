# Continuous Integration Pipeline
#
# This workflow runs code quality checks, tests, and builds on every pull request
# and push to main development branches. It ensures all contributions meet quality
# standards before being merged.
#
# Triggers:
#   - pull_request: On all PR activity to main, staging, dev, testing branches
#   - push: On commits pushed to main, staging, dev, testing branches
#
# Jobs:
#   - check: ESLint and TypeScript type checking (runs first, blocks if fails)
#   - test: Unit test suite with coverage reporting (runs in parallel with check)
#   - build: Production build (runs only after check and test pass)
#
# Permissions:
#   - contents:read - Read access to repository code
#   - pull-requests:write - Write comments to pull requests
#
# Build Artifacts:
#   - coverage-report: Test coverage data (7 days retention)
#   - dist: Built library files (7 days retention)
