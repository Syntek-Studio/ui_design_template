# Publish to GitHub Packages
#
# This workflow automatically publishes the built package to GitHub Packages
# (GitHub's npm registry) whenever a new release is published on GitHub.
# This allows team members and external consumers to install the package
# via GitHub's npm registry.
#
# Purpose:
#   - Automatically publish built packages on release
#   - Make packages available via @syntek-studio npm scope
#   - Enable installation via GitHub Packages registry
#   - Maintain parallel publishing alongside other registries
#
# Triggers:
#   - release.published: When a release is published (not draft)
#
# Permissions:
#   - contents:read - Read repository code and release info
#   - packages:write - Publish packages to GitHub Packages registry
#
# Environment:
#   - Node: v20.x
#   - Registry: npm.pkg.github.com
#   - Package Scope: @syntek-studio
#   - Auth: Uses GITHUB_TOKEN (automatically provided by GitHub Actions)
#
# Steps:
#   1. Checkout release code
#   2. Setup Node.js with GitHub Packages registry auth
#   3. Install dependencies
#   4. Build distribution files
#   5. Publish to GitHub Packages
#
# Notes:
#   - GITHUB_TOKEN is automatically provided and has write:packages permission
#   - Package must be scoped (@syntek-studio) to publish to GitHub Packages
#   - Release must be marked as "published" (not draft) to trigger
#   - Version comes from VERSION file updated during release process
